# **Introduction to On-Device AI - Qualcomm (DeepLearningAI)**

## Overview

This is a comprehensive set of notes and resources for a crash course on deploying AI models on edge devices, provided by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.DeepLearning.AI) and taught by [Krishna Sridhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikris) from [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com).

**What you'll Learn**

- Learn to deploy AI models on edge devices like smartphones, using their local compute power for faster and more secure inference.
- Explore model conversion by, converting your PyTorch/TensorFlow models for device compatibility, and quantize them to achieve performance gains while reducing model size.
- Learn about device integration, including runtime dependencies, and how GPU, NPU, and CPU compute unit utilization affect performance.

**Prerequisites**

This course is designed for `beginner` AI developers, ML engineers, data scientists, and mobile developers looking to deploy optimized models on edge devices. Familiarity with `Python`, as well as `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow` is recommended.
